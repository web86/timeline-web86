WP plugin with ability to create metabox with repeatable fields groups and show them in nice way as timeline via shortcode

I created a plugin whose task is to create metaboxes for WP posts and pages, in which, with the help of repeatable groups of fields, you can make an adaptive Timelines, for example, of the work process. The plugin is adaptive, super lightweight, and super simple. Demonstration of the plugin is on https://web86.ru/portfolio/timeline-working-process-plugin-for-wp, try to look at it from your phone and on your desktop.

How it works:
1) To get it works you need to download and install the plugin itself in the usual way. Then, in the WP “settings” menu, find the “Timeline” item and select the posts or/and pages to which you want to link the metabox with the form.
2) Then go to the editor of the page or post you specified and at the bottom you will see a metabox with the “Add new section” button, you can add as many sections and subsections as you like, for convenience, you can set your own color for each section.
3) Insert the [web86_timeline] shortcode anywhere on the page in order to show the Timeline block.
Done
